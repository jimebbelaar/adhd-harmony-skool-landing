                  Hey, I'm Jim. At 24 I got my ADHD diagnosis. Finally
                  understood why I'd started 37 projects and finished 0.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                  I tried everything. Ritalin made me a productive zombie. Time
                  blocking worked for 4 days. Discipline? I had more shame than
                  discipline.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                  Then I stopped fighting. Instead of 'managing' my ADHD, I
                  started working with it. I built systems that fit my brain.
                  Result? I now run a 7-figure digital agency.
                </p>
                <p className="text-adhd-yellow font-semibold">
                  This is what I'm giving you today: The exact method that took
                  me from chronic starter to 7-figure entrepreneur. No BS, no
                  discipline lectures. Just a system that works for ADHD brains.
